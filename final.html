<h2>More about me</h2>
<details><summary>My Childhood</summary>
<p> I am type of person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to think,to dream. I like to see the sunrise in the morning,to see the moonlight at night.The feel of the music flowing on my ears, the smell of the wind coming from the ocean. To look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter.stay up and sleep late,to get up late; i prefer to be with few friends or just to be alone, not really big fan to be surrounded by people. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes. My younger self will define himself like that. Now coming to college i realised that i was pretty boring kid</p><br>
